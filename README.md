- Initialize repo with readme
- Clone the newly created repository to your local machine.
- Add a new branch named `dev`(alternative names: `development`, `develop`).
- Make sure that the `dev` branch is pushed to GitHub.
  - git push --set-upstream origin dev
- Make the `dev` branch the default branch.
- Create a feature branch called `add-quotes`
- Add a `programmer.txt` file with the following sentence (typo is needed there):
    - "A good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crosing a one-way street."
- Add a `solve.txt` file with the following sentence:
    - "First, solve the problem. Then, write the code." â€“ John Johnson
- Add another `test.txt` file. It should be empty.
- Commit all files to your feature branch.
- Push your changes to GitHub.
- Open a new pull request from `add-quotes` into `dev`.
- Make sure that you want to merge your commits into `dev` branch.
- Keep your pull request open. you will need it in the upcoming exercises.
